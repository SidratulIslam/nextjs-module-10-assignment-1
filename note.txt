Sure! Here's a basic Next.js starter project that you can use to get started:

```
my-next-app
├── components
│   └── Header.js
├── pages
│   ├── _app.js
│   ├── api
│   │   └── hello.js
│   └── index.js
├── public
│   └── favicon.ico
├── styles
│   ├── globals.css
│   └── Home.module.css
├── .gitignore
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

Here's a brief description of the folder structure:

- `components`: This folder contains reusable React components that can be used across different pages in your application.
- `pages`: This folder contains the page components for your application. Each file in this folder corresponds to a route in your application. For example, `pages/index.js` corresponds to the `/` route, and `pages/about.js` corresponds to the `/about` route.
- `pages/api`: This folder contains API routes for your application. These routes can be used to handle server-side logic, such as fetching data from a database or an external API.
- `public`: This folder contains static assets, such as images and favicons, that can be accessed directly by their file name.
- `styles`: This folder contains global and module CSS files for styling your application.
- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and folders should not be tracked by Git.
- `next.config.js`: This file is used to configure advanced features of Next.js.
- `package.json`: This file contains information about your project, such as its dependencies and scripts.
- `README.md`: This file contains documentation for your project.
